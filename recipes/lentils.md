# Lentils


## Ingredients
- 1 bag of green lentils 
- 1 red bell pepper
- 1 can of diced tomatoes
- 1 yellow onion
- 2-3 garlic cloves
- 3 bay leaves
- Salt and Pepper to taste
- Spanish Chorizo 
- 1 beef bouillon cube
- Cooking oil of choice
  
## Directions
1. Pour the lentils into a water bath and let sit for 1 day (changing the water 2 times)
2. Sauté the bell pepper and onion until the onion is translucent
3. Add the garlic and continue sautéing until the garlic is incorporated and then add the bay leaves
4. Add the chorizo and sauté for 10-15 min
5. Add the tomatoes and salt, and pepper (not too much salt as the chorizo and bouillon cube will add saltiness) 
6. Add the lentils and cover the pot with water
7. Throw in the bouillon cube
8. Lentils will absorb a lot of water so you will have to monitor and add more water as needed until the consistency is not watery but you still want there to be a broth
