# Biscuits
Makes ~6 biscuits

## Ingredients
- 2 cups (250g) **Flour**
- 1 tbsp **Baking Powder**
- 1 tbsp **Sugar**
- 1 tsp **Salt**
- 6 tbsp **Unsalted Butter** almost frozen
- $\frac{3}{4}$ cup **Whole Milk**

## Directions
1. Preheat oven to 425F and line a cookie sheet with nonstick parchment paper. Set aside
2. Combine flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt in a large bowl and mix well. Set aside
3. Remove your butter from the refrigerator and cut it into your flour mixture
4. Add milk, use a wooden spoon or spatula to stir until combined (don't over-work the dough)
5. Transfer your biscuit dough to a well-floured surface and use your hands to gently work the dough together. If the dough is too sticky, add flour until it is manageable
6. Once the dough is cohesive, fold in half over itself and use your hands to gently flatten layers together
7. Using a biscuit cutter, cut the biscuits and place onto your prepared baking sheet. Repeat until you have gotten as many biscuits as possible and place less than 1/2" apart on baking sheet
8. Gently re-work remaining the dough to get a few more biscuits
9. Bake on 425F for 12 minutes or until tops are beginning to just turn lightly golden brown
10. If desired, brush with melted salted butter immediately after removing from oven
