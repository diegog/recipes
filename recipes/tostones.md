# Tostones
Fried green plantains

## Ingredients
- Green plantains
- Salt
- Oil

## Directions
1. Fill a bowl with water and salt heavily
2. Peel and cut plantains into ~1-1.5in cylinders and put in salt water for at least 10min (can be left in water for several hours without harm if left in refrigerator)
3. Pat plantains dry before lightly frying on medium-high heat, just until a fork can pass through them
4. While still hot, place the plantains one at a time on a moist paper towel, fold the towel over the plantain and smash down with a bowl or something similar
5. At this point the flat plantains can be frozen to be fried-through later or can be fried right away
